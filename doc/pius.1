.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pius
is a tool for individually signing all of the UIDs on a set of keys,
and emailing an encrypted copy of each such signature to the email
address associated with that UID.
.PP
As a result of this process, the recipient can choose which signatures
to import. Also, signatures of inactive uids are not delivered. This
tool greatly reduces time and error when signing keys.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-\-version\fP
show program's version number and exit
.IP "\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP"
show this help message and exit
.IP "\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-use\-agent\fP"
Use gpg-agent instead of letting gpg prompt the user or every UID. [default: true]
.IP "\fB\-A\fP, \fB\-\-all\-keys\fP"
Sign all keys on the keyring. Requires \fB\-r\fP.
.IP "\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-debug\fP"
Enable debugging output.
.IP "\fB\-b\fP \fIPATH\fP, \fB\-\-gpg\-path=\fP\fIPATH\fP"
Path to gpg binary. [default: \fI/usr/bin/gpg2\fP]
.IP "\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-encrypt\-outfiles\fP"
Encrypt output files with respective keys.
.IP "\fB\-H\fP \fIHOSTNAME\fP, \fB\-\-mail\-host=\fP\fIHOSTNAME\fP"
Hostname of SMTP server. [default: \fIlocalhost\fP]
.IP "\fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-interactive\fP"
Use the pexpect module for signing and drop to the gpg shell for entering the passphrase. [default: false]
.IP "\fB\-I\fP, \fB\-\-import\fP"
Also import the unsigned keys from the keyring into the default keyring. Ignored if \fB\-r\fP is not specified, or if it's the same as the default keyring.
.IP "\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-\-save\-to\-mail\-dir\fP"
Instead of calling SMTP, save the email to this directory. Useful for signing from an air gapped machine. The saved email files can be sent using your own MTA such as sendmail or mailx.
.IP "\fB\-m\fP \fIFROM\-EMAIL\fP, \fB\-\-mail=\fP\fIFROM\-EMAIL\fP"
Email the encrypted, signed keys to the respective email addresses using \fIFROM\-EMAIL\fP as the sender. See also \fB\-H\fP and \fB\-P\fP.
.IP "\fB\-M\fP \fIFILE\fP, \fB\-\-mail\-text=\fP\fIFILE\fP"
Use the text in \fIFILE\fP as the body of email when sending out emails instead of the default text. To see the default text use \fB\-\-print\-default\-email\fP. Requires \fB\-m\fP.
.IP "\fB\-N\fP, \fB\-\-no\-sort\-keyring\fP"
Do not sort the keyring by name.
.IP "\fB\-n\fP \fITO\-EMAIL\fP, \fB\-\-override\-email=\fP\fITO\-EMAIL\fP"

.IP "\fB\-o\fP \fIOUTPUT\-DIR\fP, \fB\-\-out\-dir=\fP\fIOUTPUT\-DIR\fP"
Directory to put signed keys in. [default: \fI/tmp/pius_out\fP]
.IP "\fB\-O\fP, \fB\-\-no\-pgp\-mime\fP"
Do not use PGP/Mime when sending email.
.IP "\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-cache\-passphrase\fP"
Cache private key passphrase in memory and provide it to gpg instead of letting gpg prompt the user for every UID. [default: false]
.IP "\fB\-P\fP \fIPORT\fP, \fB\-\-mail\-port=\fP\fIPORT\fP"
\fIPort\fP of SMTP server. [default: 587]
.IP "\fB\-r\fP \fIKEYRING\fP, \fB\-\-keyring=\fP\fIKEYRING\fP"
The keyring to use. Be sure to specify full or relative path. Just a filename will cause GPG to assume relative to \fI~/.gnupg\fP. [default: \fI~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg\fP]
.IP "\fB\-s\fP \fISIGNER\-KEYID\fP, \fB\-\-signer=\fP\fISIGNER\-KEYID\fP"
The keyid to sign with (required).
.IP "\fB\-f\fP \fIKEYID\fP, \fB\-\-force\-signer=\fP\fIKEYID\fP"
Force GnuPG to use this exact keyid to sign (do not guess subkey)
.IP "\fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-no\-mail\-tls\fP"
