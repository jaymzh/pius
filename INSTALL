INSTALLATION

For most people, installing using your OS or distribution's native package manager is the best option. However, you can install from source if you wish.

Installation from source is easy:

  ./setup.py build
  sudo ./setup.py install

This will install the modules into the site-specific place your python expects modules to go (usually something like /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/libpius) and install the pius binary in /usr/local/bin.

RUNNING FROM SOURCE DIR

You can run pius (and friends) directly from the source directory if you'd like, and it'll do the right thing. Just specify the relative or full path, ala:

  ./pius
