2.0.6
Released: 03/01/10
phil@ipom.com
- When signing all keys on a keyring, sort them first.
- Stop QP-encoding the key, as it prevents people from manually doing
    gpg -d <encrypted_file> | gpg --import
  since the decrypted payload is a MIME message with QP-encoding.  They need to
  use an intelligent MTA, or mime_dump, and this is confusing some users.  See
  the note in the code, but since this is armored in encrypted output, it
  should be safe.
- QP-encode the body... especially since we claim it's QP
- Remove the signed, but unencrypted files (potential security hole fixed here)
- Add a note to the emails that PIUS generated them, for clarity.

2.0.5
Released: 02/27/10
phil@ipom.com
- Encode keys for quoted-printable before sending them that way.
  (closes #2960095)
- Prompt for a sign-level rather than 'y' or 'n', allowing for different levels
  per key. (closes #2960103)
- Remove help text that claimed a local mail server is required for mailing off
  keys - this hasn't been true for a while (thanks to kcbraunschweig@gmail.com)
