2.0.6
Released: 03/01/10
phil@ipom.com
- When signing all keys on a keyring, sort them first.
- Stop QP-encoding the key, as it prevents people from manually doing
    gpg -d <encrypted_file> | gpg --import
  since the decrypted payload is a MIME message with QP-encoding.  They need to
  use an intelligent MTA, or mime_dump, and this is confusing some users.  See
  the note in the code, but since this is armored in encrypted output, it
  should be safe.
- QP-encode the body... especially since we claim it's QP
- Remove the signed, but unencrypted files (potential security hole fixed here)
- Add a note to the emails that PIUS generated them, for clarity.
- Use application/pgp-keys for the signed key (more RFC complaint and provides
  Evolution compatibility). Thanks to daniel@gimpelevich.san-francisco.ca.us for
  point this out.
